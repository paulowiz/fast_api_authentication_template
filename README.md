# ðŸ”¨ Installation and Running

Install the required dependencies by running:
  
1. Create account in https://signup.sendgrid.com/, and create your API_KEY following the tutorial https://www.loom.com/share/aaa6b7dfdaf046ae915dfcfd0c325c1e?sid=adcbdd61-67af-4d73-8f1a-0d0f4e54e8a2 

2. Still on SendGrid you need to go on https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth and setup your email as sender.(Because you can use on the `from` parameter on your code this email.)

3. You should have the API_KEY and the sender email to use in yours `SECRETS`.

5. Run the file `creation_script.sql` on your database.WARNING: it is deleting tables user,user_code and user role if exist.(If you dont have database you can follow the extra instructions to create your docker database.)

4. Clone this repository  
  
5. Set `SECRETS` as enviroment variable with our  sample `secrets_model.json`.

6. Install the requirements running  `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

7. Run the following command in the `python uvicorn:app"`

Extra Steps (Mysql On docker)
Reference: https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

1. Run the command to download and run the docker ` docker run --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin -d mysql:latest`

2. I already put on our `secrets_sample.json` most of things as localhost you just need to change the `password`

3.  I strongly recommend to use https://dbeaver.io/
to connect in your database.
